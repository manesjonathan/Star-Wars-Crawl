            <h1>A long time ago</h1>
            <p>I am originally from Mettet, Belgium. I grew up in a small town and always loved finding new ways to be
                creative. After finishing high school, I decided to study interior design. I moved to Brussels to study
                at the higher institute of interior design and graduated in 2012. After working as an interior designer
                for a few years, I started to feel like I needed a new challenge. That's when I decided to learn Java
                and start developing Android applications. In 2021, I released my first app, Athan Nemas, on the Google
                Play Store.</p>
